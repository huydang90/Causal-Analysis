# Causal-Analysis
A repository of my causal inference projects, including: 

1. Naval Power Replication Projects: 
The author focuses on the research question of whether increasing naval power would increase the likelihood of interstate conflicts. He intended to capture this causal effect by employing the empirical strategy of instrumental variable analysis, centering on two instruments: the length of a state's coastline and the proportion of urban population of a stateâ€™s total population. My project seeks to replicate his findings, based on World Vector Shoreline data from the World Resources Institute (2000) (for the coastline length), and the Correlates of War National Material Capabilities project (for urban population data)
